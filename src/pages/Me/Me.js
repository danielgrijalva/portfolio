          I'm a driven person who has extensive Python experience, skilled in
          software development and knowledgeable in a wide range of tools and
          technologies. I am able to effectively manage my time while working on
          my own projects, as well as collaborate with others to form a
          successful team. I'm enthusiastic about UI/UX, front-end technologies
          and data science. <br />
          Oh and I'm also <em>very</em> into music and analog photography.
